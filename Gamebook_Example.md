## Story

You're Dupak, a curious but bored rabbit.  
As your human caretakers are out of the house, you decide to make a little trip outside.

But be warned. The world outside can be hostile to young ambitious rabbits!

## 1

You move the rug and enter the secret tunnel from your cage. You lift the floor tile and jump on the floor. Through the cat entrance, you get out of the house. A harmless lime pegasus is flying over your head, flapping softly its fluffy wings.

Where do you want to go?

If you'd like to take the tram to the city center, go to **6**.  
Will you rather visit the nearby park? Go to **8**.

## 2

This is an unreachable place. Even the smartest, sexiest, and best-equipped young rabbit shouldn't be able to get here.

## 3

You push the dazzle button and the blinded griffin shrieks in agony and staggers away.
You decide that it was enough adventure for today and head home. Go to **10**.

## 4

You watch helplessly as the pirate takes off the number sign. She laughs triumphantly and jumps off the train.
Many people will be confused by the missing route number.

There's no way to go from here. It doesn't mean that this is the end of the journey, the lazy writer just hasn't written the path yet.

## 5

You dodge left and right, but the griffin drops right towards you and captures you with its mighty claws. You'll make a nice rabbitburger for the griffin dinner party. ðŸ’€

## 6

You melt into the crowd and hop on the tram. When the car starts moving, you notice a girl climbing on the car from the outside.
She's an integer pirate. These highly dangerous folks steal integer numbers for fun, causing severe disruptions to others.
The pirate wants to steal the tram line number.

Do you have an *exploding carrot*?
If so, go to **9**.
If not, go to **4**.

## 7


## 8

There, on a meadow, a Taylor Swift hologram explains assymetric cryptography to a crowd of pensioners.
You're so surprised by this occurence, that you completely forget that the park is frequented by hungry griffins who prey on dogs, smaller unattended children, and clueless rabbits.
One such gold-feathered monster is just circling above and starts diving towards you.

Do you have a headlamp? If yes, go to **3**. If not, go to **5**.

## 9

You wait till the girl reaches for the line tag and then throw the vegetable grenade at the pirate. The carrot hits the floor and explodes. The explosion shatters the windows and flings the bloodstained pirate away from the tram. The line number is safe.
You realize it's getting late and turn back home. Go to **10**.

## 10

You get inside the cage just when your people come to the front door. Noone suspects a thing.
Congratulations!
