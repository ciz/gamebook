This is a set of tools for writing a Fighting Fantasy style gamebook in markdown.

The script parses the markdown text, splits it into chapters, and performs analysis.
It then prints several statistics and generates a gameplay graph, a tree corresponding to the paths through the chapters. The directed graph is an SVG generated by graphviz.
The nodes correspond to the text chapters, and the edges connect two nodes if there's a link from one chapter to the other. The chapter text is shown in the tooltip.

A rectangular node contains a fight, whereas an oval node is a normal chapter.
The graph is color-coded to highlight various issues, such as empty chapters, double edges, unreachable nodes, missing links, and others.

See the attached Gamebook_Example files.
